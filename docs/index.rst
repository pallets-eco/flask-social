Overview
========

Flask-Social sets up endpoints for your app to make it easy for you to let your
users connect and/or login using Facebook and Twitter. Flask-Social persists
the connection information and allows you to get a configured instance of an
API object with your user's token so you can make API calls on behalf of them.
Currently Facebook, Twitter, foursquare and Google are supported out of
the box as long as you install the appropriate API library.


.. _installation:

Installation
============

First, install Flask-Social::

    $ mkvirtualenv app-name
    $ pip install Flask-Social

Then install your datastore requirement.

**SQLAlchemy**::

    $ pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy

**MongoEngine**::

    $ pip install flask-mongoengine

Then install your provider API libraries.

**Facebook**::

    $ pip install facebook-sdk

**Twitter**::

    $ pip install python-twitter

**foursquare**::

    $ pip install foursquare


**Google**::

    $ pip install oauth2client google-api-python-client


.. _getting-started:

Getting Started
===============

If you plan on allowing your users to connect with Facebook or Twitter, the
first thing you'll want to do is register an application with either service
provider:

* `Facebook <https://developers.facebook.com/>`_
* `Twitter <https://dev.twitter.com/>`_
* `foursquare <https://developer.foursquare.com/>`_

Bear in mind that Flask-Social requires Flask-Security. It would be a good idea
to review the documentation for Flask-Security before moving on here as it
assumes you have knowledge and a working Flask-Security app already.

Configuration
-------------

After you register your application(s) you'll need to configure your Flask app
with the consumer key and secret. When dealing with Facebook, the consumer key
is also referred to as the App ID/API Key. The following is an example of how
to configure your application with your provider's application values

**Twitter**::

    app.config['SOCIAL_TWITTER'] = {
        'consumer_key': 'twitter consumer key',
        'consumer_secret': 'twitter consumer secret'
    }

**Facebook**::

    app.config['SOCIAL_FACEBOOK'] = {
        'consumer_key': 'facebook app id',
        'consumer_secret': 'facebook app secret'
    }

**foursquare**::

    app.config['SOCIAL_FOURSQUARE'] = {
        'consumer_key': 'client id',
        'consumer_secret': 'client secret'
    }

**Google**::

    app.config['SOCIAL_GOOGLE'] = {
        'consumer_key': 'xxxx',
        'consumer_secret': 'xxxx'
    }

Next you'll want to setup the `Social` extension and give it an instance of
your datastore. In the following code the post login page is set to a
hypothetical profile page instead of Flask-Security's default of the root
index::

    # ... other required imports ...
    from flask.ext.social import Social
    from flask.ext.social.datastore import SQLAlchemyConnectionDatastore

    # ... create the app ...

    app.config['SECURITY_POST_LOGIN'] = '/profile'

    db = SQLAlchemy(app)

    # ... define user and role models ...

    class Connection(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
        provider_id = db.Column(db.String(255))
        provider_user_id = db.Column(db.String(255))
        access_token = db.Column(db.String(255))
        secret = db.Column(db.String(255))
        display_name = db.Column(db.String(255))
        profile_url = db.Column(db.String(512))
        image_url = db.Column(db.String(512))
        rank = db.Column(db.Integer)

    Security(app, SQLAlchemyUserDatastore(db, User, Role))
    Social(app, SQLAlchemyConnectionDatastore(db, Connection))


Connecting to Providers
-----------------------

In order to let users connect their Facebook or Twitter accounts you'll want to
add a mechanism on the profile page to do so. First the view method::

    @app.route('/profile')
    @login_required
    def profile():
        return render_template(
            'profile.html',
            content='Profile Page',
            twitter_conn=social.twitter.get_connection(),
            facebook_conn=social.facebook.get_connection(),
            foursquare_conn=social.foursquare.get_connection())

You should notice the mechanism for retreiving the current user's connection
with each service provider. If a connection is not found, the value will be
`None`. Now lets take a look at the profile template::

    {% macro show_provider_button(provider_id, display_name, conn) %}
        {% if conn %}
        <form action="{{ url_for('social.remove_connection', provider_id=conn.provider_id, provider_user_id=conn.provider_user_id) }}" method="DELETE">
          <input type="submit" value="Disconnect {{ display_name }}" />
        </form>
        {% else %}
        <form action="{{ url_for('social.connect', provider_id=provider_id) }}" method="POST">
          <input type="submit" value="Connect {{ display_name }}" />
        </form>
        {% endif %}
    {% endmacro %}

    {{ show_provider_button('twitter', 'Twitter', twitter_conn) }}

    {{ show_provider_button('facebook', 'Facebook', facebook_conn) }}

    {{ show_provider_button('foursquare', 'foursquare', foursquare_conn) }}

In the above template code a form is displayed depending on if a connection for
the current user exists or not. If the connection exists a disconnect button is
displayed and if it doesn't exist a connect button is displayed. Clicking the
connect button will initiate the OAuth flow with the given provider, allowing
the user to authorize the application and return a token and/or secret to be
used when configuring an API instance.

Logging In
----------

If a user has a connection established to a service provider then it is possible
for them to login via the provider. A login form would look like the following::

    <form action="{{ url_for('security.authenticate') }}" method="POST" name="login_form">
      {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
      {{ form.username.label }} {{ form.username }}<br/>
      {{ form.password.label }} {{ form.password }}<br/>
      {{ form.remember.label }} {{ form.remember }}<br/>
      {{ form.submit }}
    </form>

    {% macro social_login(provider_id, display_name) %}
      <form action="{{ url_for('social.login', provider_id=provider_id) }}" method="POST">
        <input type="submit" value="Login with {{ display_name }}" />
      </form>
    {% endmacro %}

    {{ social_login('twitter', 'Twitter' )}}

    {{ social_login('facebook', 'Facebook' )}}

    {{ social_login('foursquare', 'foursquare' )}}

In the above template code you'll notice the regular username and password login
form and forms for the user to login via Twitter, Facebook, and foursquare. If
the user has an existing connection with the provider they will automatically be
logged in without having to enter their username or password.


Provider API's
--------------

Flask Social is opinionated and uses available Python libraries when possible
to interact with the API's of the stock providers. This means that you'll need
to install the appropriate library for this functionality to work.

Configured instances of an API client are available via the `get_api` method
of the provider instance. For example, lets say you wany to post the current
user's Twitter feed::

    social = Social(...)

    @app.route('/profile')
    def profile():
        twitter_api = social.twitter.get_api()
        twitter_api.PostUpdate('hello from my Flask app!')
